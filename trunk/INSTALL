RTFM ! This file will be obsolete when the manual is finished.


INSTALLATION 
------------

A CVS repository for the development version is available:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@poolserver.informatik.uni-koeln.de:/home/fai/cvs login
#password fai
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@poolserver.informatik.uni-koeln.de:/home/fai/cvs co fai

Install the newest fai Debian package using apt-get or dpkg

Even the technical report was written for fai-1.0, it's good to start
with it to understand how fai works. The directory layout has changed
and new features has beeen added to fai. Read all README files for how to
build package and harddisk configurations. Since fai uses cfengine
during the last part of installation, reading the cfengine manual is
also recommended (http://www.iu.hioslo.no/cfengine/).

The file links.html contains links to all important web sites for FAI.

In our examples, the root password will be set to: fai



fai step by step
----------------
very short introduction

- install the fai package
- edit fai.conf
- copy base2_2.tgz to /tmp; otherwise make-fai-nfsroot will get this
  big file from ftp.debian.org
- call fai-setup
- configure bootpd (/etc/bootptab) and start daemon
- add installclients to netgroup @faiclients (/etc/netgroup)
- edit /usr/local/share/fai/fai_config/global.conf
- copy template files to /usr/local/share/fai
- boot installclient via network card or create boot floppy

dhcp support
------------

BOOTP is used by default. To enable DHCP you have to:

cd /boot/fai
rm faiserver
ln -s installimage-dhcp faiserver

that's all !


Access to a (local) Debian mirror: via NFS, ftp or http is needed
It's recommended to build a local mirror, in order to have access via NFS.
variables: FAI_PACKAGEDIR FAI_BASETGZ FAI_SOURCES_LIST

You have to setup a BOOTP server (bootpd) (/etc/bootptab). Fetch the
ethernet address (also called MAC address) of your network cards and
include them into bootptab. Read also README.collect_sysinfo how you
can get the ethernet addresses of your all hosts easily. There's an
example how bootptab should look like for fai.

Create a link from /boot/fai/<hostname> to installimage, if you boot
via network card or prepare the boot floppy.

Start with T171="sysinfo" to see if your computer boots successfully.

The directory layout:

/usr/lib/fai/nfsroot	contains the extracted base2_X.tgz data
/usr/lib/fai/etc	apt.conf that is used by fai
/usr/lib/fai/kernel	files for building kernel for tftp boot

cp -dpR /usr/share/doc/fai/templates/* /usr/local/share/fai


These are important FAI_ variables:



adding "sshd" to BOOTP tag T172 lets fai start an ssh daemon. You can
log in with password "fai (currently set in make-fai-nfsroot).

read_config is used two times. This is a feature, not a bug. It can be
used, when you will not use a BOOTP server.

/boot/fai/$HOSTNAME must always be a link to an installimage !


kernelimage	    if it's not pointing to a debfile, it's the
		    version for the package kernel-image-*


Start with a minimal list of packages to install.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------
FAI consists of these directories

usr
.
|-- lib
|   `-- fai
|       |-- etc
|       |-- kernel
|       `-- nfsroot
|-- local
|   `-- share
|    	`-- fai
|    	    |-- class
|    	    |-- disk_config
|    	    |-- fai_config
|    	    |-- files
|    	    |-- package_config
|    	    `-- scripts
|-- sbin
`-- share
    `-- doc
        `-- fai
            |-- examples
            `-- templates

All base FAI scripts are located in subdirectory sbin/.  The global
configuration file are in fai_config/. They are parse before the
installation begins. Subdirectory class/ contains all scripts and
files for defining classes for the client. The configuration for
partitioning the harddisk and mounting local filesystems are stored in
disk_config/. Information for software packages can be found in
packages_config/. The scripts that are executed at the end of the
installation are stored in subdirectory scripts/. Template for files
that are copied onto the clients are located in files/. Subdirectories
etc/ and kernel/ contain files for NIS and for BOOTPD and the scripts
for the building of different kernels.
