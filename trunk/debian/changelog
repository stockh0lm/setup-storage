fai (1.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * add FAI_BOOTPART class and scripts
  * *.source files now *.var, because the define variables
  * converted many cfengine scripts to shell scripts
  * new fcopy script for copying files with classes
  * new ftar script for extracting tar files with classes
  * order of classes now (with increasing priority):
    DEFAULT, <other classes>, $HOSTNAME, LAST
  * S90partitions.pl replaces the old shell version
  * klogd, syslogd running during installation
  * manual pages increased
  * make-fai-bootfloppy can take additional parameters for the kernel
  * kernel append parameters define variables in rcS_fai
  * added subroutine isclass, rwmount
  * make many variables local
  * remote login sources subroutines
  * faireboot -s saves log files to install server
  * sfdisk call removed from subroutines and Fai.pm, since it's not
    portable; unfortunately setup_hardisk is using it
  * new mount2target script; this task is removed from setup_hardisk
  * comments in files in package_config/ are now everything after a #, not
    only at the beginning of a line
  * lvm not in nfsroot by default (you must use the same kernel versions
    on server and in nfsroot)
  * remote shell and remote copy command is selectable; choose ssh/scp or
    rsh/rcp
  * all release timestamp in this changelog until version 1.4.2 are
    wrong; they indicate the time when I started hacking the version;
    these are the correct release dates (all in the year 2000):
