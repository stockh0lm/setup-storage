Template: fai/installserver
Type: string
_Description: Set install server hostname.
 Fai needs a name for the install server to be used.
 .
 In most cases this will be the hostname of the machine where the FAI
 package is installed, so we use this as a default value.
 .
 In case you want your install clients to use another install server,
 please provide it's hostname.

Template: fai/mirrorhost
Type: string
_Description: Set the hostname of the debian mirror to be used.
 Fai needs the hostname of the debian mirror used for creating
 the nfsroot and to get packages for the actual installation.
 .
 In case you are running your own debian mirror, and want to use this 
 for FAI, please enter it's hostname here. In case you don't have
 an own debian mirror, you will most probably use ftp.debian.org
 for that, which we provide as a default.

Template: fai/run-faisetup-on-install
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Run fai-setup script now?
 To be able to do installations with FAI, the script fai-setup
 needs to be run. In case you don't need to tweak the default
 fai config any further, this can be done for you now.
 .
 If you intend to have a look at and tweak the config files, it's
 perfectly O.K. if you run the script fai-setup manually after
 you consider the configuration O.K.
 .
 Do you want the fai-setup script to be run now?
