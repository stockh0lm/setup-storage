New in FAI 2.1
    - NEWS file added (you found it already ;-)
    - setup_harddisk does not complain when root partition is not in
      the first 8GB, do not complain if not a primary partition
    - no more problems when using other locales
    - woody support
    - define $FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP for using debootstrap
    - you can add your own functions using hooks
    - fai.conf has now default for installing woody/testing
    - /fai/fai_config not used anymore, replaced by a hook
    - support for diskless clients
    - grub support
    - new flag createvt; add this to FAI_FLAGS to get two additional
      terminals and ctrl-c will interrupt the installation
      process. Otherwise ctrl-c will reboot and no terminals are
      available. In the past, this function was enabled by default.
