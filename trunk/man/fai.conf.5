.SH NAME
fai.conf \- FAI Configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/fai/fai.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
FAI - Fully Automatic Installation - allows for non-interactive
initial installation and online maintenance ("softupdates") of operating systems
according to a user-defined configuration.
See
.BR fai (8)
for the possible operation modes of FAI.
.LP
To manage a set of configurations, FAI implements a concept of
classes, i.e., a list of symbolic names, which is determined at the start of
FAI on a given host.
Each host is associated with an ordered set of classes.
.LP
The configuration for a target host consists of two parts:
.IP \(bu
The
\fINFSROOT\fP, a very basic yet complete root file system,
which is exported to clients.
The NFSROOT is built using
.BR make-fai-nfsroot (8).
.IP \(bu
The
\fIconfiguration space\fP, which is loaded as one of the first steps of a FAI run.
Several tools and protocols are supported for maintaining and accessing the
configuration space.
See
.BR FAI_CONFIG_SRC
below.
.LP
.BR fai.conf
defines the essential options to successfully start a FAI run.

.SH OPTIONS
.BR fai.conf
is sourced by
.BR fai (8)
and thus must be valid
.BR bash (1)
code.
All options described below are variables that must be assigned to using
.BR bash (1)
syntax.

.TP
\fBFAI_CONFIG_SRC\fP URL to access configuration space
A protocol-specific URL defining the server and directory/repository to fetch
the configuration space from.
If left undefined, the assumed default value is
nfs://<install server>/$FAI_CONFIGDIR
.LP
The following protocols and URL schemes are currently supported:
.IP \(bu
NFS: nfs://<server>/<exported directory>
.IP \(bu
Local file: file://<directory>
.IP \(bu
CVS: cvs[+ssh]://<user>@<host>/<cvs root> <module>[=<tag>]
.IP \(bu
Subversion: svn[+(file|http|https|ssh)]://[<user>@]<host>/<repository>
.IP \(bu
Git: git[+(http|ssh)]://<git path>
.IP \(bu
Mercurial: hg+(http|https)://<hg path>
.IP \(bu
HTTP: http://<server>/<filename>
where <filename> is a (compressed) tar archive. For verification purposes, also
an
.BR md5sum (1)
generated hash must exist at the same location as <filename>, with the suffix
\.md5 replacing the suffix of <filename>.

.TP
\fBLOGUSER\fP Account name on the install server to save log files and call
.BR fai-chboot (8).
At the end of an installation,
.BR fai (8)
may connect to the install server using
.BR FAI_LOGPROTO
(see below) to store the generated log files and to change the network boot
configuration of the target host.
To fully enable this, configure .rhosts and PAM such that the configured user
can log in from all install clients without password.
This account should have write permissions for /srv/tftp/fai. For example, you
can use write permissions for the group linuxadm. chgrp linuxadm
/srv/tftp/fai;chmod g+w /srv/tftp/fai.
If the variable is undefined, this feature is disabled.

.TP
\fBFAI_LOGPROTO\fP Protocol for saving logs
Supported values are: ssh, rsh, and ftp. Defaults to ssh and will only be used
if
.BR LOGUSER
is set.

.TP
\fBFAI_DEBMIRROR\fP Access Debian mirror via NFS-mounted directory
If defined, install clients mount the NFS share to $MNTPOINT.
Syntax: <host>:<exported directory>
