.SH NAME
fai-class \- define classes using files and scripts.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fai-class
.RI [OPTION] " DIRECTORY CLASSFILE"
.SH DESCRIPTION

fai-class executes scripts in DIRECTORY to define classes. All classes
are written to CLASSFILE, each class in a line. All scripts or
executables matching "[0-9][0-9]*" are executed alphabetically. They
can define classes by writing the names of the classes to
stdout. Classes can be separated by spaces or written one on a
line. Lines that start with a "#" are comment lines and are ignored.

Shell scripts that end in ".source" are sourced and can define classes
by setting the variable $newclasses. This is useful for scripts were
you can't control stdout.

All scripts can define additional classes by writing the classes to the
file $LOGDIR/additional-classes. This temporary file will be removed
after use.

The order of the classes is important because it defines the priority
of the classes from low to high. First, the class DEFAULT is
defined. Then all scripts are executed to define classes. After that,
all classes in the file with the hostname are added. After that, the
classes from the file $LOGDIR/additional-classes are added.  Finally,
the class with the hostname and LAST is defined.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
Currently no options are supported.
.TP
.B \-d
Create debugging output.
.TP
.B \-h
Show help, version and summary of options.
.TP
.B \-T
Test if some classes are defined multiple times. This should never happen.
.TP
.B \-t tmpdir
The file additional-classes is read from directory tmpdir. Default
value is /tmp/fai/.
.TP
.B \-v
Create verbose output.


.SH EXAMPLES
.br
In FAI, fai-class is used in the following way: 

   # fai-class /fai/class /tmp/fai/FAI_CLASSES

Then a list of all classes is defined in a shell script using
following command:

    classes=`cat /tmp/fai/FAI_CLASSES`

.SH EXAMPLES FOR SCRIPTS
.ta 40n
.sp
.nf

This is the script 01alias:

#! /bin/sh

# echo architecture in upper case
dpkg --print-installation-architecture | tr /a-z/ /A-Z/
uname -s | tr /a-z/ /A-Z/

# all hosts named ant?? are using the classes in file anthill
case $HOSTNAME in
    ant??) cat anthill ;;
esac

# a Beowulf cluster; all nodes except the master node
# use classes from file class/atoms
case $HOSTNAME in
    atom00) echo BEOWULF_MASTER ;;
    atom??) cat atoms ;;
esac

# if host belongs to class C subnet 123.45.6.0 use class NET_6
case $IPADDR in
    123.45.6.*) echo NET_6 ;;
esac


Another EXAMPLE:

The script 24nis:

#! /bin/sh

# add NIS and the NIS domain name if YPDOMAIN is defined

if [ -n "$YPDOMAIN" ];then
   echo "NIS $YPDOMAIN" | tr '.a-z-' '_A-Z_'
else
   echo NONIS
fi


.sp
.fi
.PP

.SH NOTES
All class names should be written in uppercase letters (execpt the
class of the hostname). Do not use a dash, use underscore. Only
executable scripts in DIRECTORY are used. CLASSFILE is removed before
writing to it. Scripts should not directly write to CLASSFILE. LOGDIR
should not be writable for everybody.
