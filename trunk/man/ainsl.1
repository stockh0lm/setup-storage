.SH NAME
ainsl \- AppendIfNoSuchLine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ainsl
.RI [ options ] " FILE LINE [PATTERN]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Add LINE to the end of FILE if this file does not contain this line
already. If PATTERN is given, then the LINE is only appended if
PATTERN is not found in the file.

If PATTERN is not given, LINE is used instead for matching a line in
FILE. Then LINE may also contain the anchors '^' and '$' which
are only treated specialy at the beginning or end of the pattern and
are used for matching, not when adding the line. Additionaly,
the following characters are escaped in LINE: ( ) +
