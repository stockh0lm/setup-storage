.SH NAME
fcopy \- copy files using classes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fcopy
.RI [ options ] " SOURCE" ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Copy a file from SOURCE to its target using classes.
It also sets permissions modes and owner and group.
Each SOURCE argument is a directory, which contains one or more
template files for the source file to copy. Depending on the list of
defined classes one file of the source directory is selected and
copied to the target. The target filename is the name of the source
directory.

The exit code returned by fcopy is 0 if all files are copied
successfully and >0 if an error occurs. For every successfully copied
file, a log message is printed to standard output.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-c " class[,class]
Define classes. Multiple classes must be comma separated. If not
specified, use the shell environment variable $classes (space separated).
.TP
.BI "\-C " file
Read classes from \fIfile\fR. Lines can contain multiple classes which are space separated. Lines starting with # are comments.
.TP
.B \-d
Create debug output.
.TP
.BI "\-F " file
Read list of sources from \fIfile\fR. One SOURCE per line.
.TP
.B \-h
Show summary of options.
.TP
.BI "\-m " user,group,mode
Set user, group and mode for copied files (mode as octal number, user and
group numeric or name). If not specified, use data of source file.
.TP
.B \-r
Copy recursivly (traverse down the tree). Copy all files below
SOURCE. These are all directories leaves in your SOURCE tree.
.TP
.BI "\-s " source_dir
Look for source files relative to \fIsource_dir\fR (default $FAI_FILES).
.TP
.BI "\-t " target_dir
Copy files relativ to  \fItarget_dir\fR (default $FAI_ROOT).
.TP
.B \-v
Create verbose output.

.SH EXAMPLES
.br
Suppose the source directory /files/etc/X11/XF86Config consists of following files:

DEFAULT LAB CAD MACH64 server1 faifoo file-modes

Each file is an instance of a XF86Config file for a different
xserver configuration except file-modes,
which holds the file creation data. The command

    # fcopy -s /files -t /tmp/target /etc/X11/XF86Config

copies one of these files from /files/etc/X11/XF86Config to
/tmp/target/etc/XF86Config. For all defined classes, fcopy looks if a
corresponding file exists. The last matching classname will be used
for copying.

Here are examples of defined classes and the file which will be copied
by fcopy.
.sp
.nf
.ta 30n
Classes	Used File

DEFAULT,LAB,server3	LAB
DEFAULT,CAD,server1	server1
DEFAULT,MACH64,faiclient01	MACH64
DEFAULT,TFT,faiclient13	DEFAULT
.sp
.fi
.PP

In FAI (look at SEE ALSO) the list of defined classes starts with DEFAULT and the
last class is the hostname. So DEFAULT is only used, when no file for
another class exists. If a file is equal to the hostname, this
will be used, since hostname should always be the last class. 

User, group and permissions for the files can be defined in several
ways. Option -m has the highest priority and will be used for all
files, if specified. The file file-modes in the source directory can
contain one line for each class. The space separated parameter are:

owner group mode class

If class is missing, the data is used for all classes. If neither -m
or file-modes data is available, the user, group and mode of the
source file will be used for the target file. Missing subdirectories
are created with mode 0777. If the destination file already exists and
is different from the source file, the suffix .fcopy is appended. If
the files are equal, no copy is performed.

.SH NOTES
Do not create a file DEFAULT, if no evident default configuration file can be
used. It's better to exit with an error, than to copy a wrong
configuration file.

This command can also be used to maintain your configuration files on
a hughe number of hosts.
