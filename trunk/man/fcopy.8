.SH NAME
fcopy \- copy files using classes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fcopy
.RI [ options ] " SOURCE" ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Copy a file from SOURCE to its target using classes.
It also sets permission modes, owner and group.
Each SOURCE argument is a directory, which contains one or more
template files for the source file to copy. Depending on the list of
defined classes, one file of the source directory is selected and
copied to the target. The target filename is the name of the source
directory.

The exit code returned by fcopy is 0 if all files are copied
successfully and >0 if an error occurs. For every successfully copied
file, a log message is printed to standard output.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
Options -c, -s, -t (or their analog variables) and a SOURCE are required.
.TP
.BI "\-c " class[,class]
Define classes. Multiple classes must be comma separated. If not
specified, use the shell environment variable $classes (space
separated). The first class has lowest priority.
.TP
.BI "\-C " file
Read classes from \fIfile\fR. Lines can contain multiple classes which are space separated. Lines starting with # are comments.
.TP
.BI \-d
Delete target file, if no class applies.
.TP
.B \-D
Create debugging output.
.TP
.BI "\-F " file
Read list of sources from \fIfile\fR. One SOURCE per line.
.TP
.B \-h
Show help, version and summary of options.
.TP
.B \-l
Do not copy if destination is a symbolic link
.TP
.BI "\-m " user,group,mode
Set user, group and mode for all copied files (mode as octal number, user and
group numeric id or name). If not specified, use file file-mode or data of source file.
.TP
.B \-r
Copy recursively (traverse down the tree). Copy all files below
SOURCE. These are all subdirectories leaves in the SOURCE tree. Ignore
CVS directories.
.TP
.BI "\-s " source_dir
Look for SOURCE files relative to \fIsource_dir\fR. Use $FAI_FILES if
not specified.
.TP
.BI "\-t " target_dir
Copy files relativ to \fItarget_dir\fR. Use $FAI_ROOT if not specified.
.TP
.B \-v
Create verbose output.


.SH EXAMPLES
.br
Suppose the source directory /files/etc/X11/XF86Config consists of following files:

CAD DEFAULT LAB MACH64 server1 faifoo file-modes

Each file is an instance of a XF86Config file for a different
xserver configuration except file-modes,
which holds the file creation data. The command

    # fcopy -s /files -t /tmp/target /etc/X11/XF86Config

copies one of these files from the directory /files/etc/X11/XF86Config to
the file /tmp/target/etc/XF86Config. For all defined classes, fcopy looks if a
corresponding file exists. The class with the highest priority will be used
for copying. Here are examples of defined classes and the file which will be copied
by fcopy.

.sp
.nf
.ta 40n
      Defined classes	File used for copy

      DEFAULT,LAB,server3	LAB
      DEFAULT,CAD,server1	server1
      DEFAULT,MACH64,ant01	MACH64
      DEFAULT,TFT,ant13	DEFAULT
.sp
.fi
.PP

In FAI (look at SEE ALSO) the list of defined classes starts with DEFAULT and the
last class is the hostname. So DEFAULT is only used, when no file for
another class exists. If a file is equal to the hostname, this
will be used, since hostname should always be the last class. 

User, group and permissions for the files can be defined in several
ways. Option -m has the highest priority and will be used for all
files, if specified. The file file-modes in the source directory can
contain one line for each class. The space separated parameter are:

owner group mode class

where owner and group can be specified by numeric id or by name. The
file permissions are defined by mode, which must be octal. If class is
missing, the data is used for all other classes, for which no data is
defined. If neither -m or file-modes data is available, the user,
group and mode of the source file will be used for the target file.

Missing subdirectories for the target file are created with mode
0755. If the destination file already exists and is different from the
source file, the suffix .pre_fcopy is appended to the old version of
the target file. If source and target files are equal, no copy is performed.
A copied file gets the same access and modification time as the source file, not
the time of the copy.

.SH NOTES
Do not create a file DEFAULT, if no reasonable default configuration file can be
used. It's better to exit with an error, than to copy a wrong
configuration file.

This command can also be used to maintain your configuration files on
a huge number of hosts.
