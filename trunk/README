This is FAI (Fully Automatic Installation) for Linux

		Version 1.1 beta3 , june XX, 2000 (for Debian 2.2 potato)

FAI is a non interactive system to install a Debian Linux operating
system on a PC cluster. You can take one or more virgin PCs, turn on
the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed, configured and
running on the whole cluster, without any interaction necessary. Thus
it's a scalable method for installing and updating a cluster with
little effort involved. FAI uses the Debian distribution and a
collection of shell- and Perl-scripts for the installation
process. Changes to the configuration files of the operating system
are made by cfengine.
