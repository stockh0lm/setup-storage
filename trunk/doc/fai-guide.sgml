<chapt id="motivation">Motivation<p>
There was lot of motivation for creating FAI ! TODO ...

<chapt id="overview">Overview and concepts of FAI<p>
<em>Plan your installation, and FAI installs your plans.</em>
<p>
FAI is a non interactive system to install a &dgl operating system on
a single computer or a whole cluster. You can take one or more virgin
PC's, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed,
configured and running on the whole cluster, without any interaction
necessary. Thus it's a scalable method for installing and updating a
cluster unattended with little effort involved. FAI uses the &dgl;
distribution and a collection of shell- and Perl-scripts for the
installation process. Changes to the configuration files of the
operating system are made by cfengine, shell and perl scripts.

<p>
FAI's target group are system administrators how have to install
Debian onto one or even hundreds of computers. First, some terms used
in this manual are described.

<taglist>
	  <tag> install server : <item> The host where the package FAI
	  is installed. It provides several services for all install clients. </item>
	  <tag>install client : <item> The host which will be installed using
	  FAI and a configuration from the install server. Also called
	  client for short.</p> </item>
	  <tag> nfsroot : <item> A filesystem located on the install
	  server. It's the complete filesystem for the install
	  client, which is mounted by the client during booting.</item>

	  <tag> configuration : <item> The details of how the installation
	  of the clients should be performed. This includes information about:
<list>
		<item> <p>Disk layout</p> </item>
		<item> <p>Local filesystems</p> </item>
		<item> <p>Software packages</p>	</item>
		<item> <p>Keyboard layout, timezone, NIS,
		X11 configuration, remote filesystems, user accounts, printer...</p>	</item>
</list>
</taglist>

<sect id="work">How does FAI work ?<p> 

The computer which will be installed using FAI (called client) is
booted from floppy disk or via network card. It gets an IP-address and
boots a linux kernel which mounts all filesystems via NFS from a
server. After the operating system is running the FAI startup script
performs the automatic installation which doesn't need any
interaction. First, the harddisks will be partitioned, filesystems are
created and then software packages will be installed. Then the new
installed operating system is configured to your local needs. Finally
the new system will be booted from the local disk. 
<p>
The details of how to install the computer (the configuration) are stored in the
configuration space on the server. Configuration files can be shared
among multiple computers if the are similar, so you need not to create a
configuration for every new host. Hence FAI is a scalable method to
install a big cluster with a great number of nodes.

<p>
FAI can also be used as an network rescue system. You can boot your
computer without performing an installation. Instead it will run a
fully functional &dgl without using the local hardisks. Then you can
do remote login and perform backups, restore data, check filesystem,
inspect the hardware or do any other task.

<chapt id="inst">Installing FAI
<sect id="requirements">Requirements<p> 

Following items are required for an installation via FAI.

<taglist>
	  <tag>BOOTP or DHCP server <item> The clients need one of
	  these daemons to obtain information. </item>
	  <tag>TFTP server	  <item> The TFTP daemon is used for
	  transfering the kernel to the clients (only used when
	  booting from network card).</item>
	  <tag>Debian mirror	  <item> Fast access to a Debian
	  mirror is needed. A local mirror of all Debian
	  packages is recommended if you install multiple computers.</item>
	  <tag>install kernel image <item> A kernel image that supports the
	  network card and mounts its root filesystem via NFS. </item>
	  <tag>Configuration space<item> A mountable directory which contains the configuration data. </item>
	</taglist>
<p>

The TFTP daemon and a nfs server will be enabled automaticlly. The
kernel images for BOOTP and DHCP are available with the package. All
clients must have a network card, which is recognized by the kernel.
<p>

The FAI package is available as a Debian package from &faidownload;
until it will become an official Debian package (comming soon
;-)). 


<sect id=aptsetup> Setting up FAI
<p>



Most definitions for FAI are defined in <file>
/etc/fai.conf</file>. Since FAI doesn't use <prgn>debconf</prgn> yet
create this file before installing FAI for the first time.

<example>touch /etc/fai.conf</example>


FAI uses <prgn>apt-get</prgn> to create the nfsroot filesystem and when it
installs additional packages to the nfsroot.


FAI_BASETGZ
FAI_SOURCES_LIS

<var>FAI_PACKAGEDIR</var>
<example>
# example for sources.list
</example>

The last three lines are examples for a mounted directory, which
contains a local mirror of Debian. For more information on
the file format see <manref name="sources.list" section="5">.

<sect id="">Installing the FAI package <p>
About 90Mb of free disk space is needed.
<p>

During the installation of the FAI package the script
<prgn>make-fai-nfsroot</prgn> is called to create the nfsroot for
FAI. It requires a <em>base</em> file (&basetgz), which is a minimal
collection of all required packages for Debian. You need this big
(&basetgzsize) file for creating the nfsroot during the installation
of the FAI package. If you don't have a copy in <file>/tmp</file> it
will be automaticlly fetched from a location defined in
<file>/etc/fai.conf</file> and stored into <file>/tmp </file>. This
could take much time, a ftp server is used and you do not have a fast
connection to it. You can find the current version in the directory
<tt>debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/current/</tt> of your Debian
mirror. After it's available in <file>/tmp</file>, install FAI using
<prgn>dpkg -i</prgn>.

<example>
kueppers[~]# dpkg -i fai_1.4.0_i386.deb
Selecting previously deselected package fai.
(Reading database ... 39564 files and directories currently installed.)
Unpacking fai (from fai_1.4.0_i386.deb) ...
Setting up fai (1.4.0) ...
To set up FAI edit /etc/fai.conf and call fai-setup
</example>
<p>

The installation process adds lines to <file>/etc/exports</file> to export
some directories to all hosts that belong to the netgroup
<em>faiclients</em>. Netgroups can be defined in
<file>/etc/netgroup</file> or in the correspondening NIS map. An
example for the netgroup file can be found
<file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/etc/netgroup</file>. For more
information read the manual pages <manref name="netgroup" section="5">
and the NIS HOWTO. After changing the netgroups the nfs server has to
reload its configuration.

<example>
/etc/init.d/nfs-*server reload
</example>

<p>

After that, FAI is installed successfully on your server, but has no
configuration for the install clients. Start with the templates from
<tt> /usr/share/doc/fai/templates</tt> using the copy command above.


<chapt id="booting">Booting hosts <p>

Now it's time to boot your install clients for the first time. You can
use the boot floppy or configure them to boot via network card, which
is much smarter. They will fail to boot, because no BOOTPD or DHCP
daemon yet recognizes the hosts. But you can use this boot attempt to
easily collect all ethernet addresse of the network cards.

<sect id="bootfloppy">Creating the boot floppy
<p>
If your network card can't boot itself, you have to boot via
floppy. Use the command
<prgn>make-fai-bootfloppy</prgn> to creates a suitable bootfloppy
for all install clients. There's no host specific information on this
floppy, so it's suitable for all your install clients.

<sect id="bootnetwork">Set up booting via network card
<p>
If your network interface card can boot itself using the BOOTP
protocol, you should use it. See section XXX how to enable this on
some types of 3Com cards.

<list>
	    <item>
	      <p>mknbi-linux</p>
	    </item>

	    <item>
	      <p>imggen</p>
	    </item>
	  </list>
<p>

<sect id="mac">Collecting MAC addresses
<p>
You have to collect all ethernet (MAC) addresse of the install clients
and assign a hostname and IP-address to each client. So first we
collect all MAC addresses. Now boot all your install clients. While the
install client is booting, it sends broadcast packets to the LAN. You
can log the MAC addresses of these hosts, if following
command is run simultaneously on the server:

<example># tcpdump -qte broadcast and port bootpc >/tmp/mac.lis</example>

After the hosts has been send some broadcast packets (they will fail
to boot because <prgn>bootpd</prgn> isn't running or does not recognise the MAC
address yet) you abort <prgn>tcpdump</prgn> by typing <tt>ctrl-c</tt>. You get a list
of all unique MAC addresses with these commands:

<example># perl -ane 'print "0x\U$F[0]\n"' /tmp/mac.lis|sort|uniq|sed -e 's/://g'
</example>

After that, you only have to assign these MAC addresses to hostnames and
IP-addresses (<file>/etc/ethers</file> and <file>/etc/hosts</file> or
corresponding NIS maps). With these information you can configure your
<prgn>BOOTP</prgn> or <prgn>DHCP</prgn> daemon (see the section <ref id="bootptab">).

I recommend to write the MAC addresses (last three bytes will suffice
if you have network card from the same vendor) and the hostname in the
front of each chassis.

<sect id=bootptab>Configuration of BOOTP daemon
<p>

An example configuration for the BOOTP daemon is included in FAI. If
you have no <file>/etc/bootptab</file> file you can use
<file>/usr/share/doc/fai/examples/etc/bootptab</file> as template.

<example>
# /etc/bootptab example for FAI
# replace FAISERVER with the name of your install server

.faiglobal:\
	:ms=1024:\
	:hd=/boot/fai:\
	:hn:bs=auto:\
	:rp=/usr/lib/fai/nfsroot:

# rp: $NFSROOT
# your local values
#
# sa: your tftp server (install server)
# ts: your timeserver (time enabled in inetd.conf)
# T170 location of FAI configuration directory
# T171 FAI_ACTION
# T172 FAI_FLAGS, e.g. verbose, debug, reboot, sshd
# T173 reserved for future use
# T174 reserved for backup devices and backup options; NOT YET USED
# sm: subnet mask
# gw: router/gateway address
# dn: domainname
# ds: list of nameservers

# these are optional
# ys: NIS server
# yd: NIS domainname
# nt: list of NTP servers

.failocal:\
	:tc=.faiglobal:\
	:sa=FAISERVER:\
	:ts=FAISERVER:\
        :T170="FAISERVER:/usr/local/share/fai":\
	:T171="sysinfo":\
	:sm=255.255.255.0:\
	:gw=134.95.9.254:\
	:dn=informatik.uni-koeln.de:\
	:ds=134.95.9.136,134.95.100.209,134.95.100.208,134.95.140.208:\
	:ys=rubens:yd=informatik4711.YP:\
	:nt=time.rrz.uni-koeln.de,time2.rrz.uni-koeln.de:

# now one entry for each install client
faiserver:ha=0x00105A240012:bf=faiserver:tc=.failocal:T171="sysinfo":T172="sshd verbose debug ":
faiclient01:ha=0x00105A000000:bf=faiclient01:tc=.failocal:T172="sshd":
</example>

Insert one line for each install client at the end of this file as
done for <em>faiserver</em> and <em>faiclient01</em>. Replace the
string <tt>FAISERVER</tt> with the name of your server (where you
installed the package FAI). Then adjust the other network tags (sm,
gw, dn, ds) to your local needs. The tags for NIS and time servers
(yp, yd, nt) are optional. Tags with prefix <tt>T</tt> (starting from
T170) are generic tags which are used to transfer some FAI specific
data to the clients. <strong> It is important, that T171 is set to
sysinfo !</strong> Later you can set it to <em>install</em>, in order
to start the automatic installation. For more information see <manref
name="bootptab" section="5"> and section XXXXXXX (tags erklaeren).
<p>
 When you have created your <file>/etc/bootptab</file> you have to
enable the BOOTP daemon. It's installed but Debian does not enable it
by default. Edit <file>/etc/inetd.conf</file> and remove the comment
(the hash) in the line containing <tt>#bootps</tt>. Then tell
<prgn>inetd</prgn> to reload its configuration.

<example># /etc/init.d/inetd reload</example>


I recommend to use the BOOTP daemon because it automaticlly reloads
the configuration file if any changes are made to it. The daemon for
DHCP must always be manually restarted after changes to the
configuration file are made <footnote> <p>If you can't use one of
these, there's also the possibility to supply all information via a file
or compile them into the kernel, but it's easier to use a daemon. See XXXX
</p>
</footnote>. Now it's time to boot all install clients again!

<sect id="boot">Boot messages <p>

These are messages, when booting from floppy.
<example>
LILO Loading FAI-BOOTP.

When booting from network card you will see:

Fully Automatic Installation for Debian GNU/Linux
------------------------------------------------------------
.
.
.
Press &lt;RETURN&gt; to reboot or ctrl-c to execute a shell
</example>

There will be some error message from modprobe and insmod, but that
doesn't matter.  If you get the following error message the kernel has
no driver compiled in for your network card. Compile a new kernel
which support your network card.
<example>
IP-Config: No network devices available
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 < hda5 hda6 hda7 hda8 >
Root-NFS: No NFS server available, giving up.
VFS: Unable to mount root fs via NFS, trying floppy.
VFS: Insert root floppy and press ENTER
</example>


<sect1 id="sysinfo">Collecting other system information<p>

Now the clients have booted using the action <em>sysinfo</em>. Type
<tt>ctrl-c</tt> to get a shell, or log from your server into the client (for
eg. named faiclient01) using the secure shell:
<example>> ssh -l root faiclient01
Warning: Permanently added 'faiclient01,134.95.9.200' to the list of known hosts.
root@faiclient01's password: 
</example>

You have now a shell and can execute various commands (dmesg, lsmod,
df,...). Look at the log file in <file>/tmp</file>. There you can find
much information about the boot process.

All log files from <file>/tmp </file> are also written to the server in the directory <tt>~fai/faiclient01/sysinfo/</tt>

<p>
A very nice feature is, that FAI mounts all filesystems
it finds on the local disks (but only readonly). It also tell you on
which partitions a file <file>/etc/fstab</file> exists. When only one
fstab is found, the partitions are mounted according to the
information in this <file>/etc/fstab</file>. Here's an example:
<example>
faiclient01:~# df
Filesystem   1k-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/root      1249132  855648    330032  72% /
/dev/ram0         3963      36      3927   1% /tmp
kueppers:/usr/local/share/fai
               1249132  855648    330032  72% /fai
/dev/hda1        54447    9859     41777  19% /tmp/target
/dev/hda10     1153576      20   1141992   0% /tmp/target/files/install
/dev/hda9       711540      20    711520   0% /tmp/target/home
/dev/hda8       303336      13    300191   0% /tmp/target/tmp
/dev/hda7      1517948   98252   1342588   7% /tmp/target/usr
/dev/hda6       202225    8834    182949   5% /tmp/target/var
</example>

<strong>This method can be used as an rescue environment !</strong> In
future it will be possible to make backups or restore data to existing
filesystems. If you need a filesystem with read-write access try:

<example>faiclient01:~# mount -o remount,rw /tmp/target/home</example> 

Reboot the computer using the command <prgn>faireboot</prgn>.

<chapt id=instprocess>The installation process<p>

FAI can perform several action when the client is booting. This action
is defined in the variable <var>FAI_ACTION</var><footnote>
	  <p>Theses names are used in the main installation
script. The configuration files for DHCP and BOOTP daemons use other
names. Example: <var>FAI_ACTION</var> is equal to <tt>T171</tt> in
bootptab or <tt>option-171</tt> in dhcp.conf) </p>
	</footnote>.

Be very carefully if you set <var>FAI_ACTION </var> to
<em>sysinfo</em>. This can destroy all your data on the install client
(most time it will do this !). It's recommended to change this only
on a per client base in the BOOTP configuration. Do not change it in
the section <tt>.failocal</tt> in <file>/etc/bootptab</file> which
will valid for all clients.
