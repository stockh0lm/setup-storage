This is a very short FAQ. Please get involved and feel free to send patches after
your questions have been answered on the FAI mailing list!

Q: I'm new to FAI. How should I start ?

A: Read the FAI guide and this FAQ. Start with the simple examples
   FAI_CONFIGDIR. Install the stable distribution on your first clients! (See
   next question.)

Q: Which is the best (last) version, that is working with woody?

A: fai 2.5.4 with fai-kernel 1.6

Q: I try to install testing or sid (unstable) and something goes wrong.

A: testing and sid change every day. So it's possible that your problems are
   solved today or tomorrow. You should try again. It's recommendable to use a
   local mirror and freeze it when you found a working install. But we also
   recommend to use stable and local backport repositories whenever possible.

Q: Where do I find the FAI mailing list ?

A: There is a section "Mailing list" on the FAI homepage at
   http://www.informatik.Uni-Koeln.DE/fai/
   Please use your favorite search engine to search for your questions before
   posting to the list!
   Also don't post complete logs. Most times it's sufficient to describe the
   setup (which version of fai, which version of debian on the fai server and
   which version to be installed with fai) and to post the part of the log(s)
   where the error occurs. Or provide logfiles on a webserver and post a link.

Q: Is there an online FAI FAQ ?

A: Yes, at http://faifaq.andrew.net.au/

Q: I cannot login via ssh to my install client(s) anymore. It used to work but
   stopped working suddenly.

   Example:
   > ssh root@bigfoot
   @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
   @    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
   @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
   IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!

A: After you have reinstalled FAI on your server a new ssh host key is
   generated. This also happens when you call "fai-setup" or "make-fai-nfsroot".
   Remove the relevant line from ~/.ssh/known_hosts and try again.
