In order to take a step into that direction, I can contribute
a "mini howto" on the creation of a FAI Boot Floppy:
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Make a kernel image that fits your personal needs. I suggest
to make a .deb package with the kernel-package provided by
the debian distribution. Select the following options (the
sections refer to the configuration scheme of kernel 2.2.15) :

 * Floppy disk support (in section "Block devices"); you may not
   compile it as a module since you will boot from the floppy

 * RAM disk support (section "Block devices")

 * IP: kernel level autoconfiguration (section "Networking options")
 *     BOOTP support (section "Networking options")

 * NFS filesystem support (section "Network File Systems")
 * root filesystem on NFS (section "Network File Systems")

 * be sure to include the appropriate ethernet card driver(s)

2. Insert an empty floppy. Since we will use LILO to boot from the
   floppy, we will need to make an ext2 filesystem on the floppy:

# mke2fs /dev/fd0

3. Install the previously built kernel on the floppy:

# mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /floppy
# cd /floppy    
# dpkg --fsys-tarfile /tmp/kernel-image-2.2.15_custom.1.0_i386.deb | tar xvf -

4. Make a symbolic link from /vmlinuz to your kernel and copy
the boot block:

# ln -s boot/vmlinuz-2.2.15 ./vmlinuz
# cp /boot/boot.b /floppy/boot/

5. Make a dummy NFS boot device in /dev:

# mknod /dev/boot255 c 0 255

6. Prepare a lilo.conf file somewhere (e.g. in /tmp). Here is my choice:

boot=/dev/fd0
root=/dev/boot255
install=/floppy/boot/boot.b
map=/floppy/boot/map
vga=extended
append = "nfsroot=<ip address of fai server>:/usr/lib/fai/nfsroot"
delay=10
compact
image=/floppy/vmlinuz
        label=FAI-nfsroot
        read-only

This will work in my environment where the basic network configuration
(but not the additional fai parameters) are provided by bootp/dhcp.
This is convenient because I can use the same boot floppy for every
PC that I want to install. If you do not have bootp/dhcp you can
hardcode the network configuration as an additional kernel parameter:
ip=<client-ip>:<server-ip>:<gw-ip>:<netmask>:<hostname>:<device>:<autoconf>
(for additional information see Documentation/nfsroot.txt in your kernel
sources).

BTW: We use Lilo as a boot loader rather than writing the raw kernel
image to the floppy because this gives us the possibility to supply
additional kernel parameters.

7. Make the floppy bootable with Lilo:

# lilo -C /tmp/lilo.conf

8. Unmount the floppy:

# cd /; umount /floppy

9. Make the floppy read-only and try to boot. Hopefully it works :-)
   Apart from installation I use this floppy as a "rescue floppy"
   whenever I cannot boot from disk anymore or when I do not want
   to touch the local hard disk (i.e. fsck on /).
