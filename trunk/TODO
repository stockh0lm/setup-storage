TODO list for FAI, oct 23, 2001
--------------------------------
  
1. Support other Linux distributions (Red Hat, Suse,...). This should
   be the work for other people.
2. Booting a kernel with pcmcia support for automatic installation of
   notebooks and laptops; if the kernel supports this, no problem for me
3. readable log files may contain encrypted passwords
4. redesign of setup_harddisk tool
   use mkfs instead of mke2fs
   support for other filesystem types and raid
   preserve partition layout, preserve data
   always clean /, /var and /usr
6. debconf support

-------
Wishes:
-------

- apt-get remove should really purge
- T175 additional mount (eg. for /usr/local)
- stop fai installation ( killall -STOP ....) script
  faisstop (kill apt-get, yes, ...)
