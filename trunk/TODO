TODO list for FAI, june 20, 2000
--------------------------------
-- means done

0. To be on holiday
1. Support other Linux distributions (Red Hat, Suse,...). This should
   be the work for other people.
2. Booting a kernel with pcmcia support for automatic installation of
   notebooks and laptops 
-- Cleanup the code of some perl scripts
4. /fai/class/S*.{pl,sh} scripts should check and resolve
   dependencies. I think this is not necessary.
-- Make some change in rcS to run with Debian 2.2 and futher releases
-- load other kbd map with loadkeys during installation
-- write new install-packages.pl that uses new apt-get features
-- Create CVS repository for FAI
9. Make FAI an official Debian package
10. readable log files may contain encrypted passwords
11. DHCP support
12. using nilo, etherboot,.. for booting from network card
13. manual pages for setup_harddisk/disk_config (section 5)
--  adduser fai in postinst
15. install_packages should understand "dpkg --get-selection" output format
16. rewrite of setup_harddisk: use mkfs instead of mke2fs (support for
    other filesystem types; no type means default=ext2), preserve
    bootable flags ? always clean /, /var and /usr ?
17. write a tutorial, manual, user's guide,.. regarding the new
    features of FAI 
18. set default keymap using FAI_KEYMAP without cfengine script
    (loadkeys, dumpkeys >default.map)

These are the most important tasks I will do next time: 0 9 16 17, maybe 11

pass paramter in kernel command line 

for all in /proc/cmdline 

if match \w=\w
   eval match


- build keyboard map using dumpkeys
- REMOVE should really purge
- T175 addition mount (eg. for /usr/local)
- preremove, postremove action in install_packages, pre= before upgrade,
  post= after apt-get install
