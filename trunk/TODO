TODO list for FAI, november 15, 2000
-----------------------------------
-- means done
  
0. To be on holiday
X. Support other Linux distributions (Red Hat, Suse,...). This should
   be the work for other people.
2. Booting a kernel with pcmcia support for automatic installation of
   notebooks and laptops 
-- Cleanup the code of some perl scripts
X. /fai/class/S*.{pl,sh} scripts should check and resolve
   dependencies. I think this is not necessary.
-- Make some change in rcS to run with Debian 2.2 and futher releases
-- load other kbd map with loadkeys during installation
-- write new install-packages.pl that uses new apt-get features
-- Create CVS repository for FAI
9. Make FAI an official Debian package
10. readable log files may contain encrypted passwords
-- DHCP support
--. using nilo, etherboot,.. for booting from network card
13. manual pages for setup_harddisk/disk_config (section 5)
--  adduser fai in postinst
15. install_packages should understand "dpkg --get-selection" output format
16. rewrite of setup_harddisk: use mkfs instead of mke2fs (support for
    other filesystem types; no type means default=ext2), preserve
    bootable flags ? always clean /, /var and /usr ?
17. write a tutorial, manual, user's guide,.. regarding the new
    features of FAI 
--. set default keymap using FAI_KEYMAP without cfengine script
    (loadkeys, dumpkeys >default.map)
--. module support in kernel
20. debconf support

These are the most important tasks I will do next time: 17 9 16

Wishes:
-------

- pass paramter in kernel command line 
  for all in /proc/cmdline 
      if match \w=\w
         eval match
      fi
- REMOVE should really purge
- T175 additional mount (eg. for /usr/local)
- preremove, postremove action in install_packages, pre= before upgrade,
  post= after apt-get install
- stop fai installation ( killall -STOP ....) script
  faisstop (kill apt-get, yes, ...)
- faireboot should call save_log_remote on request
- if FAI_BASETGZ is unused (always default), remove wget in
  debian/control
