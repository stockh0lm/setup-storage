<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

<a name="version"></a>
<h2>Which FAI version is the right one for me?</h2>

<p>There are two official supported versions of FAI:</p>

<p>The <strong>3.4.x releases</strong> are the stable versions and should be
used if you need a reliably working FAI system without problems when
upgrading.</p>

<p>The <strong>4.x releases</strong> are the testing versions and provide the
bleeding edge features and most recent development. Upgrading from any 3.x
release to 4.x might break your setup, but if you are interested in the latest
features and testing FAI the 4.x releases are the right choice for you.</p>

<p>Please note that versions older than 3.4 are not supported anymore, please
consider upgrading! If you do not know which version is the right one for you
just choose the most recent 3.4.x release.</p>

<a name="download"></a>
<h2>Which repository do I have to use to get FAI for lenny/squeeze/...?</h2>

<p>If you want to deploy Debian <strong>squeeze</strong> the entry for
/etc/apt/sources.list and for /etc/fai/apt/sources.list should contain
(Note/Todo: TBC!):</p>

<div class="featurebox"><h3> <!-- brrrrrr, this is dirty, Thomas!-->
<pre>
deb http://fai-project.org/download squeeze koeln
</pre></h3></div>

<p>Tip: You can use this squeeze repository also for deploying lenny. See <a
  href="http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/fai/branches/stable/3.4/doc/lenny-instructions.txt">/usr/share/doc/fai-doc/lenny-instructions.txt</a>
of package fai-doc for instructions.</p>

<p>If you want to deploy Debian <strong>lenny</strong> the entry for
/etc/apt/sources.list and for /etc/fai/apt/sources.list should contain:</p>

<div class="featurebox"><h3> <!-- brrrrrr, this is dirty, Thomas!-->
<pre>
deb http://fai-project.org/download lenny koeln
</pre></h3></div>

<p>If you want to get the <strong>experimental</strong> FAI versions, please use
the following entry in /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/fai/apt/sources.list:</p>

<div class="featurebox"><h3> <!-- brrrrrr, this is dirty, Thomas!-->
<pre>
deb http://fai-project.org/download experimental koeln
</pre></h3></div>

<p><strong>TODO/Discuss:</strong> provide 3.4.x for lenny and etch?</p>

<a name="ubuntu"></a>
<h2>Is FAI available for Ubuntu?</h2>

<p>Yes, please visit <a href="https://launchpad.net/~fai/+archive/ppa">the PPA
  for Ubuntu FAI webpage</a> for details.</p>

<a name="kernel"></a>
<h2>I need a more recent hardware support/kernel version</h2>

<p>FAI by default uses the same kernel version as present in Debian.  Depending
on the time-frame since the last Debian release this kernel might not support
the most recent hardware. The <a href="http://grml.org/">Grml</a> live system
provides Debian packages of recent kernel versions which can be used within FAI,
just following <a href="http://wiki.fai-project.org/index.php/Grml_Kernel">the
  instructions from the Grml_Kernel page in the wiki</a>.</p>

<a name="dash"></a>
<h2>I get strange errors like 'ifclass: not found' during execution</h2>

<p>Debian supports /bin/dash as interpreter for /bin/sh. FAI uses bash scripts
which aren't supported by dash. If you notice errors like 'ifclass: not found'
during execution of FAI make sure to use '#!/bin/bash' as shebang line in your
scripts instead of '#!/bin/sh'.</p>

<a name="two_dhcp_servers"></a>
<h2>Using two DHCP daemons in the same subnet</h2>

<p>If you have two DHCP daemons in the subnet of your FAI infrastructure,
and one uses the option <em>allow unknown-clients</em> you are in trouble,
because if this daemon responses faster it will give the install
client an IP address and the other daemon has no chance to control the
clients boot parameters for FAI.</p>

<p>The solution for this problem is to use the '<em>ignore booting</em>'
instruction. So you have a DHCP daemon A which includes the <em>allow
  unknown-clients</em> option. In the same subnet you would like to run a second
DHCP daemon B for the FAI infrastructure which includes <em>deny
  unknown-clients</em> and contains a
list of all the install clients using their MAC address.</p>

<p>Since you know the MAC addresses of the install clients (that should be
controlled by B), you can instruct DHCP daemon A to ignore those clients.
For each install client you add a line into DHCPd.conf (of DHCP A) like
this:</p>

<div class="featurebox"><h3> <!-- brrrrrr, this is dirty, Thomas!-->
<pre>
host demohost {hardware ethernet 00:42:23:11:be:af;ignore booting;}
</pre></h3></div>

<p>That's it. If demohost does a PXE boot, DHCP A will ignore it, and
DHCP B can answer the request.</p>

<a name="bugreports"></a>
<h2>Where should I report bugreports?</h2>

<p>Please report bugs against the according FAI Debian package (fai-client,
fai-server,...) using <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/reportbug">reportbug</a>
to <a
  href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?src=fai">bugs.debian.org</a>.
If you do not know how to use reportbug please write a mail to the <a
  href="/mailinglist/">linux-fai mailinglist</a>.</p>
