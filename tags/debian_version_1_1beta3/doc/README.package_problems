The installation of packages (without interaction) depends on the
success of apt-get (using dpkg). But some packages are broken and an
error occurs during installation. Some workarounds are made in rcS_fai
in the subsourine prepare_apt. Most problems occur if postinst script
has a loop, when all questions are answered with <Return> or
n<Return>.

Following table describes the problems with postinstall script.

INPUT is what is typed to all questions of the postinstall script.
The value of the cossespondening column means:

L = script go into a loop (will ask forever)
O = OK (script finishes successfully)

Following packages are know to have errors:

libpaperg    (divert error in version -12), loop if input is not a valid papersize 
xf86setup
xserver-svga (does not like n<Return>)
ntp	     (does not like n<Return>)
telnetd	     must installed before nis (adduser hangs ?)
gcc	     causes dpkg to segfault sometimes depending on packagelist
ssmtp	     hostname --fqdn breaks in chroot environment
