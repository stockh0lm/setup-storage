How to set up a FAI install server on Debian lenny using FAI 3.4.x
==================================================================

FAI 3.4.x is ready-to-go for Debian Squeeze, but can also be used
on a server running lenny.

- Add this line to /etc/apt/sources.list:

    deb http://fai-project.org/download squeeze koeln

- Install new FAI 3.4.x packages on your system

- Replace any occurrences of 'squeeze' with 'lenny' in the
  following files:

  /etc/fai/make-fai-nfsroot
  /etc/fai/apt/sources.list

- Add the aufs-modules package to /etc/fai/NFSROOT:

  < linux-image-486
  > linux-image-486 aufs-modules-2.6-486

- Since fai 3.4.x is only available in the squeeze repository of
  fai-project.org (and depending on the date possibly also from
  Debian squeeze and unstable/sid) add this line to
  /etc/fai/apt/sources.list

     deb http://fai-project.org/download squeeze koeln

- Call fai-setup -v or make-fai-nfsroot -v

- In the config space you have to add the class GRUB (providing
  grub1) to your install clients instead of the class GRUB_PC
  (providing grub2). Have a look at class/50-host-classes.

- When building a fai-cd, use option -G1.
