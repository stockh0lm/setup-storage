since fai-1.1beta3: please look at changelog file


The directory layout of FAI has changed since fai 1.0.1 !
--------------------------------------------------
fai-1.1beta2: june 20, 2000

- script faireboot for easy rebooting
- package_config can now preload a file before installing a package
  (usefull for realplayer, fai,..)
- install_packages called in different ways depending on FAI_FLAGS
  (verbose,debug) for better debugging
- a "mini howto" on the creation of a FAI Boot Floppy doc/fai-boot-floppy.txt
- S24 echoes NONIS if no nisdomain is defined
- allways call the new lilo ${target}/sbin/lilo
- apt-get upgrade before installation of packages
- define_classes is called when FAI_ACTION is sysinfo
- two configuration examples: faiserver and faiclient01
- Class renamed: MAINTAINER -> DEBIAN_DEVEL
- start-stop-daemon is now faked in a better way
- fai.pl renamed to Fai.pm, new location
- use make-fai-nfsroot if you do not want to mount /usr from a server (default)
- some tests which nfs server you are using; only the user space
  nfs-server is supported until now
- testsize (Fai.pm) tests if lower < size <= upper
- blocksize of harddisk will now be determined in Fai.pm (not fixed to 512 bytes)
--------------------------------------------------
fai-1.1beta1:

- examples that are not used are now put into the subdirectory example
- metapackages are used for software selection (package names task-*)
- now using lprng instead of lpd (lpd always started daemon during installation)
- class REBOOT removed. reboot can now be set via FAI_FLAGS (T172) or
  in class/S*.source
- base2_X.tgz can now be retrieved via ftp and http using wget
- NO second reboot is needed ! S99finish.sh is obsolete
- using the tools from kernel-package, now it's easy to create and
  install a kernel and his modules for a host. /fai/files/boot and
  /fai/files/modules not used any more, because we have a Debian
  package for the kernel
- FAI now has serveral actions. If you only want some hardware
  information, you can get it without installing anything. See bootp
  tag $T171 or $FAI_ACTION (thanks to Thomas Gebhardt for this idea)
- a lot of cfengine actions are now unnecessarily, because there's a
  finer selection of software (eg. rstat-client, rstatd). Former these
  services must be disabled in inetd.conf
- resolv.conf is used during installation
- the full location of /usr is now defined in fai.conf
- new options for setup_harddisk (-X -m)
- totally new rewritten install_packages.pl
- call lilo from $target; it's version must match with files in /boot
- if the correct amount of memory is not detected, you can define it
  in $liloappend
- a lot of software packages are gone, renamed, new or better one
  available so files in package_config also had changed (eg. now lprng
  instead of lpd)
- timezone is now a variable, not fixed in cfengine
- you can now load a different keytable (eg. german keyboard)
--------------------------------------------------
FAI 1.0.1: january 19, 2000

- setup_harddispk.pl now calculates partition sizes more exactly, it
  checks all filesystems before mounting them (setup_harddisk.pl)
  It also mounts filesystems read-only if they should be
  preserved. Ignore error messages (read-only filesystem) when
  extracting base2_1.tgz. This is a feature, not a bug.
  It can handle different output of old and new sfdisk executables.

- the link name to the (tftp) image for booting from local disk is now
  specified with $TFTPLINK; previously it was always a link to the
  file clusterimage (rcS,class/S*.source)

- if host if in class MBR, lilo will write the master boot record
  (mbr) otherwise, mbr will be left intact and only the boot sector of
  the root partition is written (scripts/BOOT)

- class LAST is now always the last class (S99last.sh)

- S99var.source now S91var.source; variable definition depending on
  hosts should be defined after S91* (eg. S99kueppers.sh)

- start-stop-daemon is disabled during installation (rcS)

- rcS is now a bash script, and trap also starts a bash (formerly sh
  script), the quit signal (ctrl-\) also calls trap

- BOOTP tag T172 holds a space separated list of flags, that will be
  set to 1 inside rcS (verbose, debug are now used)

- installkernel now supports Adaptec AIC7xxx based SCSI controllers

- Thomas Renard has done some work on FAI for Red Hat RPM Systems
  http://www.netcologne.de/~nc-renardth/fai/

- doc/links.html is a file, that contains all important links, so you
  can easily click and jump to these pages

Configuration and Release Notes

The file installkernel includes now the new 3c90x-1.0.0e network card
driver from 3Com and should run with most types of hardware (even 386 XXXXX
CPU's). FAI is currently tested with Debian 2.XXX (potato).

The configuration was used and optimized for these computers
(hostname: hardware equipment):

faiserver, faiclient01:
		dual Pentium II
			IDE disk
			3Com 3c905B network card
			no CD-ROM

kueppers:		K7 Athlon
			IDE disk
			Tekram SCSI adapter
			SCSI CD-ROM
			3Com 3c905C network card
