INSTALLATION 

Install the newest fai Debian package using apt-get or dpkg

Even the technical report was written for fai-1.0, it's good to start
with it to understand how fai works. The directory layout has changed
and new features has beeen added to fai. Read all README files for how to
build package and harddisk configurations. Since FAI uses cfengine
during the last part of installation, reading the cfengine manual is
also recommended (http://www.iu.hioslo.no/cfengine/).

The file links.html contains links to all important web sites for FAI.
In our examples, the root password will be set to: fai
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
FAI consists of these directories

usr

fai step by step
----------------

Access to a (local) Debian mirror: via NFS, ftp or http
It's recommended to build a local mirror, in order to have access via NFS.

You have to setup a BOOTP server (bootpd) (/etc/bootptab). Fetch the
ethernet address (also called MAC address) of your network cards and
include them into bootptab. Read also README.collect_sysinfo how you
can get the ethernet addresses of your all hosts easily. There's an
example how bootptab should look like for fai.

Create a link /boot/fai/installimage, if you boot via network card or
prepare the boot floppy.

Start with T171="sysinfo" to see if your computer boots successfully.

The directory layout:

/usr/lib/fai/nfsroot	contains the extracted base2_X.tgz data
/usr/lib/fai/etc	apt.conf that is used by fai
/usr/lib/fai/kernel	files for building kernel for tftp boot

cp -dpR /usr/share/doc/fai/templates/* /usr/local/share/fai


All base FAI scripts are located in subdirectory sbin/.  The global
configuration file are in fai_config/. They are parse before the
installation begins. Subdirectory class/ contains all scripts and
files for defining classes for the client. The configuration for
partitioning the harddisk and mounting local filesystems are stored in
disk_config/. Information for software packages can be found in
packages_config/. The scripts that are executed at the end of the
installation are stored in subdirectory scripts/. Template for files
that are copied onto the clients are located in files/. Subdirectories
etc/ and kernel/ contain files for NIS and for BOOTPD and the scripts
for the building of different kernels. 

These are important FAI_ Vairables:

XXXXX




FAI_NFSSERVER_USR	Where the clients are going to mount the /usr 
			from. Not required.

read_config is used two times. This is a feature, not a bug. It can be
used, when you will not use a BOOTP server.


/boot/fai/$HOSTNAME must always be a link to an installimage !


kernelimage	    if it's not pointing to a debfile, it's the
		    version for the package kernel-image-*


Start with a minimal list of packages to install.
