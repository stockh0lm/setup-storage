see http://faiwiki.informatik.uni-koeln.de/index.php/Development_with_quilt for how to use
this tree with quilt. 
- QUILT_PC may be stored wherever you like
- QUILT_PATCHES must be set to <this dir>/patches/

The following procedure was suggested on linux-fai-devel (verbatim copy, may be
updated later on):
- Use quilt as documented above, and direct it to the place where you have
  checked out the people/michael/experimental/patches/ directory. (Well, we
  might want to move this somewhere else, but for now everyone should feel free
  to commit in there.)

- Add a header to your patch, using quilt header -e, which is formatted in a
  Changelog like way:

2008-08-28  Your Name  <your@mail>

  * some_file: Your changes
  * more_files: More changes

  In vim, set the filetype to changelog and use \o to get a template, and most
  probably emacs also has some changelog mode to assist you.

- Commit the patch file to SVN. Please try to make your patches selfcontained
  and as independent of other patches as possible. This will help Thomas in
  picking single patches from the list whenever deemed appropriate.

- Once you commit, an automatic build of the experimental fai package on
  svn.debian.org will be triggered. This again triggers a download to a
  repository, where from the packages are made available. *Note* that this is
  not yet enabled, but I'd expect it to be up and running in the next days. The
  scripts doing the work may be found in the repository in
  people/michael/experimental/. For now, build logs are mailed to my address,
  but we might want to change this to mailing them to the committer. One further
  possible feature would be automated mails to the bug tracking system and
  tagging some bug reports "patch", of course including the corresponding patch.
  Well, there is lots of possibilities, all of which require a bit of work and
  some disussion.

Happy hacking,
Michael
