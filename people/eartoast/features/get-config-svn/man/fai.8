.SH NAME
fai \- fully automatic installation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fai
.RI [ options ] " ACTION"
.SH DESCRIPTION

fai starts a fai-action, e.g. an installation or a softupdate.
If the variable FAI_ACTION is defined, this action will be
performed. The command line argument will override the value of
FAI_ACTION. You can also define your own actions which will be
executed when specified.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
ACTION is required.
.TP
.B \-C CFDIR
Use CFDIR as configuration directory. Default is /etc/fai.
.TP
.BI "\-c|\-\-class " class[,class]
Define classes.  Multiple classes must be comma separated.  If not
specified, use the shell environment variable $classes (space
separated).  The first class has lowest priority.
.TP
.B \-h|\-\-help
Show help, version and summary of options.
.TP
.B \-N|\-\-new
Renew the list of defined classes. By default, FAI uses the list of
classes which was created during the first installation and skips
calling fai-class(1). You need to use this option for the first 
softupdate if the system was not installed with FAI, and you can use
it in subsequent runs as well.
.TP
.B \-v|\-\-verbose
Create verbose output.
