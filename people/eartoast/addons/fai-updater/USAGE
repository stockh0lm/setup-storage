You get basic usage information running 'updater-curses --help'.

Connecting to the clients:
the script libexec/faiupdate is used to connect _non-interactively_ to the
clients and start an update there, forwarding stdout to the fai-updater.

A script using ssh is included, but of course you can edit it to match 
your own needs.
To be able to connect to the clients using the provided libexec/faiupdate, 
you need to have some way to access them via ssh as root without entering
a password.
A solution for this is to install a matching file as 
/root/.ssh/authorized_keys, start ssh-agent and load the private key 
into it _before_ starting fai-updater.
Another, but from a security point of view dangerous, possibility is to
use a passphrase-less ssh private key into the account under which you run 
fai-updater.
