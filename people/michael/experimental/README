see http://faiwiki.debian.net/index.php/Development_with_quilt for how to use
this tree with quilt. 
- QUILT_PC may be stored wherever you like
- QUILT_PATCHES must be set to <this dir>/patches/

If possible, either make patches independent of each other, or put depending
ones into a single patch. This helps cherry picking in that each patch then also
applies to the pristine trunk.
