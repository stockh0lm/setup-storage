If you can't run Debian Live, don't despair! The Debian Live team is
ready to help you! We are interested in hearing about problems, because
in general they don't happen to only 0fone07 person.
We've either already heard about your particular problem and can dispense a
quick fix, or we would like to hear about it and work through it with you,
and the next user who comes up with the same problem will profit from your
experience!

See the mailinglist and wiki for more information; both
are available at the Debian Live web site, 0fhttp://live.debian.net/07
