fai-kernels (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * removed kernel 2.4 
  * therefore also removed alpha build as no 2.6 config for fai-kernels for
    alpha exits :-(
  * build SATA nvidia driver as a module on i386 (Closes: #366423)
  * build all megaraid drivers as modules on i386 and amd64 (Closes: #375843)
  * confirmed that the package conforms to debian-policy 3.7.2

fai-kernels (1.10.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * upgraded to build with 2.6.16
  * enabled aacraid driver (as module) in i386, amd64 and powerpc 2.6 kernels
    as well as in powerpc 2.4 kernels (closes: #357918)

fai-kernels (1.10.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * updated to use 2.6.15
  * the test, if the patch for #328707 applies, now works as intended. 
    (That means fai-kernels builds with kernel-source-2.4.27-12 in sid.)
  * increased CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE=8192 as this is needed for the new
    fai-cd and also matches the debian default kernels
  * added arch specific build-depends on kernel sources
  * bugfix: don't copy the 2.6 kernel config on alpha - the real fix (tm)
    should be to build 2.6 fai-kernels on alpha... as I don't have an 
    alpha I'm waiting for someone to send that config to the BTS
  * build HW_RANDOM as module on archs that support it (2.6 only) - requested
    by user via private mail (please use the BTS instead)
  * build with CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE=y as requested by user via private mail 
  * set CONFIG_FUSION=y as it's an option, not a driver
  * more driver needed for 2.6 i386, requested by Thomas Lange (TULIP, 
    CONFIG_DE4X5, CONFIG_WINBOND_840, CONFIG_DM9102, CONFIG_ULI526X)
  * the i386, amd64 and powerpc kernel configs have been re-generated with 
    "make menuconfig" so in future it will be easier to diff them. The alpha
    config still needs to be updated that way. 
  * enabled CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_ULI=m (and therefore experimental drivers) on
    2.6 on i386 and amd64 as requested by Thomas Lange.

fai-kernels (1.10.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * added build-depends on gcc-3.3 (closes: #340884)

    powerpc and amd64 as well as on 2.4 on powerpc
  * streamlined support for Fusion MPT on i386 and amd64
  * added support for 2.4 fai-kernels on alpha - thanks to Steffen Grunewald

fai-kernels (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * fai-kernels was removed as requested in #323183. Unfortunatly neither
    Thomas Lange (the former maintainer) nor me was informed of that action
    before it was done. 
    This makes FAI unpleasent to use in unstable, and since FAI is in heavy 
    development at the moment we would like to have as many testers as possible 
    - so we decided to re-upload fai-kernels.
    As this is done now, I will stick to my original plan, which is using
    standard debian kernels with "nfsroot"-initrds for FAI. This will make
    fai-kernel unnecessary so it _then_ can be removed again.
  * added support for amd64 and ppc 
  * updated README.non-i386 accordingly
  * updated to use linux-tree-2.6.14 instead of 2.6.8
  * apply the patch for #328707 to kernel-source-2.4.27 during build-time, so 
    that it builds with the latest binutils. As 2.4.27-12 will hopefully soon
    be uploaded with the patch included, the patch will only be applied, if it
    applies cleanly without errors.
  * dont merge kernel config snipplets, rather use one config file per arch
    and kernel version (2.4/2.6)
  * added some drivers for various network cards and scsi controllers 
    (closes: #328232)
  * updated README (closes: #328230)
  * append "fai-kernels" to version of the build kernel-packages instead of
    "fai"
  * updated the FSF address in copyright
  * confirmed that the package conforms to debian-policy 3.6.2
  * made build-dependency to debhelper versioned and raised debian/compat to
    a non-deprecated value
  * added myself to maintainers field
