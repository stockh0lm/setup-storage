these are some helper scripts to ease FAI development and testing.

for now it's mostly targeted to development of or testing with fai-cd.

You'll need debooststrap, maybe a Debian mirror, pbuilder (read pbuilder docs
for a nice introduction),and qemu, everything gets faster when using the kqemu
accelarator kernel module.

Go to the directory that you want to make a fai development environment (does not
need to be the FAI source directory where you want to develop your code) and start
with running fai-dev-preparedevenv as root or with sudo (needed for chroot
creation). Most commands will need to be run as root or with sudo, because chroots
are involved everywhere. I didn't come to think about how to make that better.

ask henning@sprang.de when you have questions or suggestions.

This stuff here is not well tested on other environments than mine, so it might
completely destroy all of your system,you shouldnot use it without checking the
full shell script code for possible troubles when you run that stuff on your
system
